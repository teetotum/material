    <h2>What do I want to find out?</h2>
    <p>
      Can event handlers that were attached via the two different ways ("onevent
      property / attribute" and "addEventListener") coexist, or will the one
      that was attached later overwrite the one that was attached earlier?
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens to an "onevent property" assigned event handler when a second
      one is assigned?
    </p>

    <script>
      function globalClick(e) {
        console.log(`registered via onclick="..." attribute; is active`);
      }
    </script>

    <button id="btn" onclick="globalClick(event)">Click</button>

    <script>
      const button = document.getElementById("btn");

      const addEventListener_handler = (e) => {
        console.log("registered via 'addEventListener'; is active");
      };

      const onevent_handler = (e) => {
        console.log("registered via onclick; is active");
      };

      button.addEventListener("click", addEventListener_handler);
      button.onclick = onevent_handler;
    </script>
