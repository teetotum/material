# What HTML5 can learn from Silverlight

# Don't event.stopPropagation() - instead mark as handled : on event cancellation

# how to handle DOM events while staying sane

# don't stopPropagation()

judging by the questions (and answers) on SO, and judging by the code I see in projects, it seems a mayor cause for headache for many javascript Developers
how to deal with a hierachy of event handlers that subscibed to the same bubbling event on different level in the DOM tree.

While I understand that the new navigation event is much better, at 7:08, you should be adding a single click event listener on the window and filter for link clicks, instead of looping through every single link and adding listeners separately. Event delegation is your friend!

Totally agree. This doesn't always work in practice, which is why frameworks like Next give you a link component, just so they can add the events.

@Jake Archibald just out of curiosity, when would it not work? Is it because having an img or so inside a link would make the image be the e.target or what's going on?

@Leander Berg it's mostly cases where other event listeners jump in do things like stopping propagation of the event

@Theodoros Antoniou unless someone else also adds a capturing event ðŸ˜€. The point is, a navigation event like this avoids those issues, and also captures navigations that aren't the result of clicking a link.

@Jake Archibald The first capturing event listener added to the window object cannot be prevented by any other listener. Such a listener will always see all events no matter what.
I call this the "prime listener" and I use it when I need guaranteed access to an event regardless of what any other listener is doing.

  the event.handled flag from WPF corresponds to event.defaultPrevented in HTML5

# HTML5 event handling is broken - here is how to fix it

# proper event handling in HTML5

# prepare to have your mind blown

# why HTML5 event handling is broken

# flawed

stickpunkte:

- show example of dropdown-in-dropdown and (botched) ESC key handling
- those who only know one technology are forced to accept the particular flavor as the real thing
- JS-only devs have a skewed understanding of Events
- Events: an implementation of GOF design pattern, baked into a language feature
- pub/sub
- man kann von anderen UI technologien ein paar gute ideen fÃ¼r HTML5 UIs Ã¼bernehmen
- event.isHandled and event.markAsHandled
- event.stopPropagatinon() vs preventDefault

```jsx
const isHandled = (e: Event) => e.defaultPrevented;
const isEscape = (e: KeyboardEvent) => e.key === 'Escape';
const isSpace = (e: KeyboardEvent) => e.key === ' ';
const markHandled = (e: Event) => e.preventDefault();

<div
      tabIndex={0}
      className={classnames(style.dropdownList, className)}
      ref={ref}
      onKeyDown={(e: any) => {
        if (!isHandled(e) && isEscape(e)) {
          setIsOpen(false);
          markHandled(e);
        }
        if (!isHandled(e) && isSpace(e)) {
          setIsOpen((_) => !_);
          markHandled(e);
        }
      }}
